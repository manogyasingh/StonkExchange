# Simple Stock Exchange

A lightweight stock exchange simulation built with Flask. This project implements a basic automatic order book system.
## How It Works

The system maintains an order book with two sides:
- **Bids**: Buy orders sorted by price (highest first)
- **Asks**: Sell orders sorted by price (lowest first)

When orders are placed, the system automatically tries to match compatible orders:
1. If the highest bid price â‰¥ lowest ask price, a trade occurs
2. The trade executes at the ask price
3. The buyer's balance decreases and their stock quantity increases
4. The seller's balance increases and their stock quantity decreases

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python orderbook/app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

4. Login or register with a username and password

## Usage
